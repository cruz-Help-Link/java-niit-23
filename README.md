#### Getting Started with Java

1. **Install Java Development Kit (JDK)**:
   - Download and install the latest JDK from the [Oracle website](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk11-downloads.html) or [OpenJDK](https://openjdk.java.net/).
   - Follow the installation instructions for your operating system.

2. **Set Up Your Development Environment**:
   - Choose an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) like [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/), [Eclipse](https://www.eclipse.org/), or [NetBeans](https://netbeans.apache.org/).
   - Alternatively, you can use a simple text editor and compile your code from the command line.

3. **Verify Your Installation**:
   - Open a terminal or command prompt.
   - Type `java -version` and `javac -version` to check if Java is installed correctly.

4. **Write Your First Java Program**:
   - Create a new file named `HelloWorld.java` with the following content:
     ```java
     public class HelloWorld {
         public static void main(String[] args) {
             System.out.println("Hello, World!");
         }
     }
     ```
   - Compile the program by running `javac HelloWorld.java`.
   - Run the compiled program by running `java HelloWorld`.

5. **Explore the Projects in This Repository**:
   - Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/cruz-Help-Link/java-niit-23.git`
   - Navigate to a project: `cd java-niit-23/HelloWorld`
